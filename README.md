![social](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a07609a-d537-4032-a549-8fc8ec351220)

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed tools on your computer:

01. Node.js: React requires Node.js to run. Download and install the LTS version.
02. Git: Needed to clone repositories from GitHub.

### Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

  ---
  - ##### Find the GitHub Repository URL
  Go to the GitHub page of the React project you want to run. Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.


  - ##### Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
  On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS or Linux, use the terminal.


  - ##### Clone the Repository
        git clone <repository-url>
  Run the following command, replacing <repository-url> with the URL you copied:

  ##### Example:
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

  - ##### Navigate into the Project Directory
        cd repository-name
  Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
  Replace repository-name with the actual directory name of your cloned project.

#### 2. Install Dependencies
---
  - ##### Ensure You’re in the Project Directory
        ls
  Verify you are in the correct directory where the package.json file is located:
  You should see a file named package.json.

  - ##### Install Node Modules
        npm install
  Run the command above to install the necessary dependencies:

  ##### Alternatively, if you use Yarn as your package manager, run:
        yarn install

### 3.  Run the React Project
---
  - ##### Start the Development Server
  ###### Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
      npm start

  ###### Or, if using Yarn:
      yarn start
  This command will start the React development server and open the project in your default web browser.

  - ##### View the Project
  The React development server typically runs on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser if it doesn’t open automatically.
