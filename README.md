# How to Run a React Project from GitHub after installation

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed tools on your computer:

01. Node.js: React requires Node.js to run. Download and install the LTS version.
02. Git: Needed to clone repositories from GitHub.

### Steps

## 1. Clone the Repository

  ## 1. Find the GitHub Repository URL
  Go to the GitHub page of the React project you want to run. Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.

  ## 2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
  On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS or Linux, use the terminal.

  ## 3. Clone the Repository
  Run the following command, replacing <repository-url> with the URL you copied:
  ### git clone <repository-url>

  Example:
  ### git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

  ## 4. Navigate into the Project Directory
  Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
  ### cd repository-name
  Replace repository-name with the actual directory name of your cloned project.

## 2. Install Dependencies
  ## 1. Ensure You’re in the Project Directory
  Verify you are in the correct directory where the package.json file is located:
  ### ls
  You should see a file named package.json.

  ## 2. Install Node Modules
  Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  ### npm install

  Alternatively, if you use Yarn as your package manager, run:

  ### yarn install

## 3.  Run the React Project
  ## 1. Start the Development Server
  Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
  ### npm start

  Or, if using Yarn:
  ### yarn start

  This command will start the React development server and open the project in your default web browser.

  ## 2. View the Project
  The React development server typically runs on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser if it doesn’t open automatically.
